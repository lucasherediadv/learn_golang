# Practice exercises

- [ ] Change the test so a caller can specify how many times the character is repeated and the fix the code.

- [ ] Write "ExampleRepeat" to document your function

- [ ] Have a look through the [strings](https://golang.org/pkg/strings) package. Find functions you think could be useful and experiment with them by writing test like we have here. Investing time learning the standard library will realy pay off over time.
